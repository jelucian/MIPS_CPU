# MIPS_CPU
FPGA Implementation of a MIPS Processor

CPU Implements a subset of MIPS instructions.
ALU executes 28 different operations.
Reg File containes 32 32-bit registers, with $r0 set to 32'h0 and cannot be overwritten
Integer_Datapath instantiates both ALU and Reg File and connects them in one module 
Execution Unit is a Finiste State Machine with control words generated by the contents of the Instruction Register
MIPS_CPU instantiates and interconnects all modules of the CPU
