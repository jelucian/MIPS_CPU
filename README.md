# MIPS_CPU
FPGA Implementation of a MIPS Processor

-CPU Implements a subset of MIPS instructions\n
-ALU executes 28 different operations
-Reg File containes 32 32-bit registers, with $r0 set to 32'h0 and cannot be overwritten
-Integer_Datapath instantiates both ALU and Reg File and connects them in one module
